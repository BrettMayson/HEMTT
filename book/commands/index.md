## Options

### --just

The [`build`](/commands/build.md) and [`dev`](/commands/dev.md) commands can be used to build a single addon. It can be used multiple times to build multiple addons.

```bash
hemtt build --just myAddon
```

```admonish danger
It is advised to only use this on very large projects that take a long time to build.
It is advised to only use this after running the command once without `--just` to ensure all addons are built.
Anytime you run any git commands that can modify files, you should run without `--just` to ensure all addons are up to date.
Before reporting any unexpected behavior, try running without `--just` first.
```

## Global Options

### -t, --threads

Number of threads to use, defaults to the number of CPUs.

### -v

```admonish note
