`hemtt launch` is used to build and launch a dev version of your mod. It will run the [`hemtt dev`](dev.md) command internally after a few checks, options are passed to the `dev` command.

You can chain multiple configurations together, and they will be overlayed from left to right. Any arrays will be concatenated, and any duplicate keys will be overridden. With the below configuration, `hemtt launch default vn ace` would launch with all three configurations. Note that `default` must be specified when specifying additional configurations, `default` is only implied when no configurations are specified.

## Configuration

`hemtt launch` requires the [`mainprefix`](../configuration/index.md#main-prefix) option to be set.

Launch configurations can be stored in either `.hemtt/project.toml` under `hemtt.launch`, or in a separate file under `.hemtt/launch.toml`. The latter is useful for keeping your main configuration file clean. When using `launch.toml`, the `hemtt.launch` key is not required.

**.hemtt/project.toml**

```toml
mainprefix = "z"

# Launched with `hemtt launch`
[hemtt.launch.default]
workshop = [
    "450814997", # CBA_A3's Workshop ID
]
presets = [
    "main", # .html presets from .hemtt/presets/
]
dlc = [
    "Western Sahara",
]
optionals = [
    "caramel",
]
mission = "test.VR" # Mission to launch directly into the editor with
parameters = [
    "-skipIntro",           # These parameters are passed to the Arma 3 executable
    "-noSplash",            # They do not need to be added to your list
    "-showScriptErrors",    # You can add additional parameters here
    "-debug",
    "-filePatching",
]
executable = "arma3" # Default: "arma3_x64"
file_patching = false # Default: true
binarize = true # Default: false
rapify = false # Default: true

# Launched with `hemtt launch vn`
[hemtt.launch.vn]
extends = "default"
dlc = [
    "S.O.G. Prairie Fire",
]

# Launched with `hemtt launch ace`
[hemtt.launch.ace]
extends = "default"
workshop = [
    "463939057", # ACE3's Workshop ID
]
```

**.hemtt/launch.toml**

```toml
[default]
workshop = [
    "450814997", # CBA_A3's Workshop ID
]

[vn]
extends = "default"
dlc = [
    "S.O.G. Prairie Fire",
]
```

### extends

### workshop

A list of workshop IDs to launch with your mod. These are not subscribed to, and will need to be manually subscribed to in Steam.

### optionals

A list of optional addon folders to launch with your mod.

### mission

The mission to launch directly into the editor with. This can be specified as either the name of a folder in `.hemtt/missions/` (e.g., `test.VR` would launch `.hemtt/missions/test.VR/mission.sqm`) or the relative (to the project root) path to a `mission.sqm` file or a folder containing it.

### parameters

A list of [Startup Parameters](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3:_Startup_Parameters) to pass to the Arma 3 executable.

```

### -e, --executable &lt;executable&gt;

The Arma 3 executable to launch. Overrides the `executable` option in the configuration file.

```

### --no-filepatching

Do not launch Arma 3 with `-filePatching`.

Any options after `--` will be passed to the Arma 3 executable. This is useful for passing additional [Startup Parameters](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3:_Startup_Parameters).

```bash
hemtt launch -- -world=empty -window
```
