# Hooks

HEMTT supports hooks at various points in the build process. The hooks are written using [Rhai](https://rhai.rs/). Rhai has an [extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rhaiscript.vscode-rhai) that provides syntax highlighting.

Some example Rhai scripts can be found on the [Rhai Playground](https://rhai.rs/playground/stable/). Additional commands can be requested as a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/BrettMayson/HEMTT/discussions/categories/hook-commands).

Hooks are stored in the `.hemtt/hooks/{phase}` folders. The `{phase}` is the name of the phase that the hook is run in. The hooks are run in alphabetical order.

**Example**

```
.hemtt
└── hooks
    ├── pre_build
    │   ├── 01_example.rhai
    │   └── 02_example.rhai
    └── post_build
        ├── 01_example.rhai
        └── 02_example.rhai
```

## Phases

There are 4 phases of the build process that can be hooked into:

| Hook           | File System                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pre_build`    | [Virtual](library/filesystem.md#hemtt_vfs---virtual-file-system) |
| `post_build`   | [Virtual](library/filesystem.md#hemtt_vfs---virtual-file-system) |
| `pre_release`  | [Real](library/filesystem.md#hemtt_rfs---real-file-system)       |
| `post_release` | [Real](library/filesystem.md#hemtt_rfs---real-file-system)       |

### `pre_build`

The `pre_build` hook is run before any preprocessing, binarization, or packing PBOs. This is the place to modify files that will be packed into the PBOs.

### `post_build`

The `post_build` hook is run after all preprocessing, binarization, and packing PBOs. It is run before any release tasks.

### `pre_release`

The `pre_release` hook is run before any release tasks. It is only run during the [hemtt release](../../commands/release.md) command.

### `post_release`

The `post_release` hook is run after all release tasks, and archives have been created. It is only run during the [hemtt release](../../commands/release.md) command.
