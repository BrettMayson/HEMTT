# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a mod from scratch. It will cover the basics of setting up a project, testing it, and releasing it.

This guide will only cover the process of building a mod, it will not cover SQF, model, or texture creation.

## Workspace Setup

Before you begin creating mods for Arma 3, you will need some tools.

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

It's important to use a version control system when developing mods. Git is the most popular version control system, and HEMTT has some features that integrate with it.

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

While any text editor will work, Visual Studio Code is the recommended editor for HEMTT. It is a powerful editor that has a lot of features that will make your life easier. It has several extensions that are great for Arma 3 modding.

### [Arma 3 Tools](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Tools)

If you are working with models or maps, you will need to install the Arma 3 Tools. These tools are used to convert models and maps to the Arma 3 format, however, this guide will not cover that process.
